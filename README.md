## PS2 MDDN 342 2018

I have 5 sliders mapped to different things - the mouth, head, bow and eyes.

Slider 1 - maps to the eyes, so one eye blinks depending on the slider value.
Slider 2 - maps to the mouth opening and closing.
Slider 3 - maps to the head tilt.
Slider 4 - maps to the bow. Turns it on and off or changes colour.
Slider 5 - The opacity of the head and ears changes.

Have trained the data set to these parameters:

- Eye Colour maps to the opacity, so brown eyes are solid colour and blue eyes are the opposite.

- Guys with light hair left eye blinks (our left)

- Guys with dark hair right eye blinks

- Girls with dark hair have red bow and closed eyes

- Girls with light hair have blue bow and open eyes

- Tilt matches persons head

- Mouth depends on where the mouth on the image is

Trained a lot of the faces and tried out the Training Quiz. From doing the training quiz I have found that it is working and i can correctly choose the right face 90% of the time. I have noticed that i need to add one or two more parameters to make sure that the faces are more distinctly different.

Im thinking that I could use skin tone and whether or not a person has facial hair as my new parameters.

Fully mapped my face to the landmarks of the chin, eyes, eyebrows etc. It has made my faces look both better and worse in different ways. I think it has helped to give the faces more expression but it also makes it a little harder to tell what they are supposed to be. Overall though I quite like them mapped to the face as they look less mask like.

Finished retraining all my values, in the main photos they dont fully map how i want them to but in the training quiz I can guess the correct faces 99% of the time.

Overall I really like how this has turned out but I think it definitely needs at least one more parameter to really make the faces different and stand out.
